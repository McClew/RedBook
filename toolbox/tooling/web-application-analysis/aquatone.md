# Aquatone

Aquatone is a tool for visual inspection of websites across a large amount of hosts and is convenient for quickly gaining an overview of HTTP-based attack surface. Aquatone, is similar to [eyewitness.md](eyewitness.md "mention") and can take screenshots when provided a `.txt` file of hosts or an Nmap `.xml` file with the `-nmap` flag.
